# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
Kickstarter, a crowdfunding platform, helps bring creative projects to life. The platform allows creators to share their project ideas with world in hopes those interested contribute to the overall fundraising goal. As an up-and-coming playwright, Louise is particularly interested in an analysis of Kickstarter data that will help guide fundraising decision making for her play, *Fever*.
### Purpose
The purpose of the project is to gain a greater understanding of the factors that influence the success of Kickstarter campaigns. Variables of interest include campaign lauch date and funding goals of similar projects. An understanding of the data will help identify what makes a campaign successful.
## Analysis and Challenges
Data from over 4,000 Kickstarter projects were imported to be analyzed in Excel. Data include both completed and live projects from around the world in multiple categories (e.g., technology, film, theater).
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The total number of successful, failed, and canceled theater projects were plotted with the month each project was initiated. As can be seen in the graph below, there is a spike in successful theater projects in spring/early summer and throughout the summer months.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The total number of successful, failed, and canceled projects were also plotting in relation to the fundraising goal of each project. As can be seen in the graph below, there appears to be a strong relationship  between fundingraising goal and project success. The data suggest the greater the fundraising goal the greater the likelihood the project will be unsuccessful.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Estimated budger of over 10,000
## Results
### Conclusions
#### Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Several conclusions can be drawn from the *Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date* graph. First, the data suggests the probably of a sucessful campaign is greater than the probability of a failed campaign for theater projects. This is seen in the greater number of successful campaigns throughout the year. In addition, the data also suggests campaigns that are launched in spring and throughout the summer have a higher likelihood of success than those launched in fall and winter.
#### Outcomes Based on Goals
Several conclusions can also be drawn from the *Outcomes Based on Goal* graph. The data suggests there is a relationship between funding goal and campaign success. It can be interpreted that the higher the funding goal, the higher the liklihood of the project eithing failing or being cancelled. Likewise, the lower the campaign goal, the higher the likelihood of a successful campaign.
### Limitations and Future Analysis
There are a few notable limitations to the dataset. The *Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Data* graph displayd projects from around the world. As there are significant seasonal difference between the northern and southern hemispheres and other difference in climate between countries, the graph should be interpreted with caution. A more reliable analysis of the data may include data from only North America or the United States to eliminate seasonal differences. In addition, the *Outcomes Based on Goal* graph displays goals in US Dollars. Again, as project from around the world are representeded, it is not clear whether the data included conversion factors to standardize monetary values. Future analysis may include this standardization. In addition, the analysis did not address the percentage of goal reached. For example, the current analysis listes a campaign that was $1 under goal as failed when in reality the campaign was quite successful.
